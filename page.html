  <h1>Life of a Cat in Germany</h1>
  <p id="text"><span class="quote">‚ùù</span>There is a cat which lives in Bamberg alongside his brother (Leo). The cat's name is Tutu and he likes his name, therefore whenever you call him with his name, he comes as fast as he could. That shows, he's happy with his name. Sometimes, he does some naughty things which makes his brother confused, therefore they fight to make it clear who's the boss.</p>
